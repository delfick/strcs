Changelog
---------

.. _release-0.5.0:

0.5.0 - 11 May 2025
    * Changed development tooling
    * strcs is now Python 3.13+
    * The 0.5.0 branch will see more changes so that it works with later versions of cattrs

.. _release-0.4.1:

0.4.1 - 14 September 2024

    * Added a dependency constraint to cattrs. Seems that newer version of cattrs
      breaks this library

.. _release-0.4.0:

0.4.0 - 15 October 2023
    * Add a ``disassemble`` method to the type cache and implemented ``disassemble``
      on ``strcs.Type`` using it. Note that the signature also changes to no
      longer have an "expect" but also it's smarter about the resulting Type
      it returns.
    * Made ``strcs.Type`` and related functionality all understand
      ``typing.NewType`` objects.

.. _release-0.3.0:

0.3.0 - 17 September 2023
    * Introduced a number of helpers for introspecting type annotations
    * Introduced new ``strcs.Type`` class for representing types and creators
      now take these objects.
    * Can now create and use creators for generics so that when using the register
      to create an object, the filled type vars of the provided type are
      understood and respected.
    * Updated dependencies
    * Converted packaging to hatchling
